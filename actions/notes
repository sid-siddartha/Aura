Why the actions Folder Exists


1. The actions folder is a common convention (especially in Next.js and similar modern frameworks) for separating "server actions" or business logic from your UI components.

2. It contains functions that perform jobs like database operations, authentication, and mutations (creating, updating, or deleting records).

3. By placing this code in actions, you keep your code modular, secure, and maintainableâ€”the UI layer calls these actions, rather than performing business logic directly.
