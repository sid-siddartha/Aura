  //User: This is the type of that relation field, meaning this field links to the User model.
  //@relation(...): This attribute configures how the relation works:
  //fields: [userId]: Specifies that the field userId in this model (Account) is the foreign key that holds the reference.
  //references: [id]: Specifies that the userId field refers to the id field of the User model, linking these two fields.
  //onDelete: Cascade: Specifies the database cascade behavior — if a referenced User record is deleted, all related Account records will also be automatically deleted.

  //HERE onDelete cascade mean on with realation with userId of table Account with id of table user when the user is deleted that accounts related to user will also be deleted
  //therefore the attribute is @relation(fields : [Id of current table] , [Id of the table in which it is in relation with], on delete what happens)
