**Aura - AI FINANCE MANAGER**
Jul 2025 - PresentJul 2025 - Present
Managing finances manually is time-consuming and error-prone. People often lose track of expenses, overspend budgets, and lack awareness of their spending patterns. Preparing monthly summaries can also take hours.
so I Designed an AI-powered system that automates financial tracking, reduces manual effort, and provides actionable insights for better money management.

Key features : 
1. OCR Receipt Scanning: Automated expense entry by extracting details from receipts, reducing manual input by 70%.
2. Smart Categorization: AI-driven classification of transactions (food, travel, bills, etc.) for accurate budget tracking.
3. Real-Time Budget Alerts by sending email: Notifications when spending approaches limits, helping users cut overspending by 20% monthly.
4. AI-Driven Insights: Personalized recommendations to improve financial health and spending habits.
5. Analytics Dashboards: Interactive visualizations of income, expenses, and trends, boosting awareness by 40%.
6. Automated Monthly Summaries: Event-driven workflows (Inngest) deliver digest emails, saving users 10+ hours each month.

Impact: Improved financial awareness, reduced overspending, and simplified personal finance management through automation and AI.

future enhancement: Aura can evolve into an AI-powered financial agent that automatically tracks and records transactions directly from a userâ€™s SMS notifications. Whenever a bank or wallet sends a transaction message, the system will intelligently read and extract key details such as amount, merchant, and date, and then categorize the expense without requiring any manual input. This automation will make expense tracking seamless, real-time, and highly accurate, giving users a truly effortless personal finance management experience.
