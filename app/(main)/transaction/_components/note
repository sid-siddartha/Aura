Problem Statement

Today, we have UPI apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, and many others, but none of them provide a proper budget tracking system. For example, if someone spends 50% of their monthly income, these apps don‚Äôt notify the user. As a result, people often spend all their money without realizing it.

Solution ‚Äì AI Finance Manager

To solve this problem, I am building a web-based AI Finance Manager that helps users track their expenses in a smarter way.

Key Features:

Visual Dashboard
The platform will provide clear visual representations of account transactions and expenses, helping users understand where their money is going.

Budget Alerts
Users can set a monthly budget (e.g., ‚Çπ6000). If spending crosses 50% of the budget (‚Çπ3000 in this case), the system will automatically send an alert email, reminding the user to manage their expenses wisely.

AI-Powered Receipt Scanning
Since people are often too lazy to manually enter every transaction, the system will allow users to simply upload a picture of their receipts. Using AI (via Gemini API), the platform will automatically extract the details and fill out the expense form‚Äîmaking tracking fast and effortless.

Monthly Financial Report with Insights
At the end of every month, the system will generate and email a detailed financial report. This report will include insights, showing where most of the money was spent, and provide suggestions on how to save more in the next month.

Would you like me to also reframe this into a polished pitch deck format (problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí features ‚Üí impact), so you can use it for presentations or investors?
